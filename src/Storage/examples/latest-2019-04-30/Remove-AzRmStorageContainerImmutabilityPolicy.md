### Example 1: Aborts an unlocked immutability policy.
The response of delete has immutabilityPeriodSinceCreationInDays set to 0.
ETag in If-Match is required for this operation.
Deleting a locked immutability policy is not allowed, only way is to delete the container after deleting all blobs inside the container. (autogenerated)
```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-AzRmStorageContainerImmutabilityPolicy -ContainerName myContainer -Etag {Etag} -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -StorageAccountName {StorageAccountName}
```
