### Example 1: The Enable-AzSqlInstanceAdvancedDataSecurity cmdlet enables Advanced Data Security on a managed instance. Advanced Data Security is a unified security package that includes Data Classification, Vulnerability Assessment and Advanced Threat Protection for your managed instance. (A new storage account will automatically be created for saving vulnerability assessments. If a storage account was previously created for this purpose, it will be used instead) (autogenerated)
```powershell
