### Example 1: When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all child resources inherit the same lock.
To create management locks, you must have access to Microsoft.Authorization/ or Microsoft.Authorization/locks/ actions.
Of the built-in roles, only Owner and User Access Administrator are granted those actions. (autogenerated)
```powershell
PS C:\> New-AzResourceLock -Force {Force} -LockLevel {LockLevel} -LockName ContosoSiteLock -LockNotes {LockNotes} -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup
```
