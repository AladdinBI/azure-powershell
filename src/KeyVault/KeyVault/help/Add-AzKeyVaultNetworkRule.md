### Example 1: The Add-AzKeyVaultNetworkRule cmdlet grants or restricts access to a key vault to a set of caller designated by their IP addresses or the virtual network to which they belong. The rule has the potential to restrict access for other users, applications, or security groups which have been granted permissions via the access policy. (autogenerated)
```powershell
PS C:\> Add-AzKeyVaultNetworkRule -IpAddressRange 10.0.1.0/24 -VaultName myvault
