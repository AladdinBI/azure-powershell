### Example 1: The delete key operation cannot be used to remove individual versions of a key.
This operation removes the cryptographic material associated with the key, which means the key is not usable for Sign/Verify, Wrap/Unwrap or Encrypt/Decrypt operations.
This operation requires the keys/delete permission. (autogenerated)
