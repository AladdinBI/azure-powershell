### Example 1: Imports an existing valid certificate, containing a private key, into Azure Key Vault.
The certificate to be imported can be in either PFX or PEM format.
If the certificate is in PEM format the PEM file must contain the key as well as x509 certificates.
This operation requires the certificates/import permission. (autogenerated)
