### Example 1: Power off (stop) one or more virtual machines in a VM scale set.
Note that resources are still attached and you are getting charged for the resources.
Instead, use deallocate to release resources and avoid charges. (autogenerated)
```powershell
PS C:\> Stop-AzVmss -Confirm  -Force {Force} -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -VMScaleSetName {VMScaleSetName}
```
