### Example 1: Adds or updates a V2 (non-classic) metric-based alert rule. The added rule is associated with a resource group and has a name. This cmdlet implements the ShouldProcess pattern, i.e. it might request confirmation from the user before actually creating, modifying, or removing the resource. (autogenerated)
```powershell
PS C:\> Add-AzMetricAlertRuleV2 -DisableRule
