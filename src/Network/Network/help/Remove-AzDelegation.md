### Example 1: In this example, the first half (found under "Add a delegation to an existing subnet") is identical to Add-AzDelegation. In the second half, the first two cmdlets retrieve the subnet of interest, refreshing the local copy with what's on the server. The third cmdlet removes the delegation that was created in the first half from mySubnet and stores the updated subnet in $subnet. The final cmdlet updates the server with the removed delegation.

```powershell
PS C:\> Remove-AzDelegation -Name myDelegation -Subnet $subnet
```
