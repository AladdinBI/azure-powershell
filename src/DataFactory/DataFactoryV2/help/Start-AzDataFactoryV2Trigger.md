### Example 1: The Start-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger cmdlet starts a trigger in a data factory. If the trigger is in the 'Stopped' state, the cmdlet starts the trigger and it eventually invokes pipelines based on its definition. If the trigger is already in the 'Started' state, this cmdlet has no effect. If the Force parameter is specified, the cmdlet doesn't prompt before starting the trigger. (autogenerated)
