### Example 1: This command creates a new sync group within a specified storage sync service. A sync group is used to describe a topology of locations, referred to as endpoints, that will sync any files stored within any one of the endpoints. A sync group contains cloud endpoints, which reference Azure file shares, and it also contains server endpoints which reference a specific local path on a registered server. (autogenerated)
