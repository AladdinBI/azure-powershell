### Example 1: This cmdlet creates a new service topology in the resource group ContosoResourceGroup with the name ContosoServiceTopology and in location Central US. The absence of an artifact source reference indicates that the artifacts required for the service unit definitions in this topology would be provided as absolute SAS URIs in the service unit.
